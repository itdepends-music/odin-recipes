        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Temporal anomalies were once so common that not even the Red Hands considered to stockpile any.
            Due to an enemy currently unknown to all but the most powerful Odins, the supply of temporal anomalies
            has almost been completely eliminated. While temporal anomalies was previously the largest component of
            the diet of any Odin, the unavailability for the last 7198 years has prevented anyone but the highest
            casts from consuming the substance. This is the currently the only known method of producing temporal 
            anomalies, however Odin scientists are working tirelessly to reduce the cost of artificial anomaly production.

        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>7999999998 Ates Rods</li>
            <li>1543333 kg Anda Fluid</li>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Mix the Anda Fluid and Ondes Catalysts. 
                Note that a small mismatch in quantity of ingredients will produce a dangerous qtttre class entity.
            </li>
            <li>
                Insert Anda Fluid at the rate of 19.82754 mg/h. 
                Any modification in the rate or quantity of Anda fluid inserted will result in a dangerous thmayl class entity.
