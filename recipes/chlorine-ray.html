        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>
            Chlorine rays were once a delicacy for the Odins, representing the finest delicacy possible.
            However this changed after the discovery of SYH-027485, a dimension consisting entirely of chlorine.
            The Chlorine cartel tried to prevent knowledge of this dimension from entering the general population,
            however the effort was mostly futile. Modern day Odin's regard the food as disgusting, however the food
            is still used in Odin rituals due to it's prior status as a product of luxury. This has been a continued
            barrier for Odin's attempting to increase their social cast.
